# Legal AI Analytics and Fraud Detection System

## Problem Statement
Insurance companies face significant losses due to fraudulent claims, but detecting fraud based on legal patterns from court cases remains a complex challenge. Our solution addresses this by combining AI, data scraping, and predictive modeling to identify fraudulent claims and classify cases under relevant legal sections.

## Overview
Our solution predicts and detects potential fraud in insurance claims by analyzing litigation patterns from scraped legal records across Indian court orders and petitions. Using advanced AI technologies like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and GraphSage, we deliver actionable insights to insurers, achieving a fraud detection accuracy of at least **82%**.

## Features
### 1. **Fraud Detection**
   - **AI-driven classification** of cases using GNNs and GraphSage.
   - Minimum fraud detection accuracy of **82%**.
   - Classification under relevant legal sections associated with fraud.

### 2. **Real-Time Alerts**
   - Automated **email and SMS notifications** for detected fraud incidents.
   - **On-dashboard notifications** with clear segregation of fraud cases for immediate awareness and response.

### 3. **Comprehensive Data Management**
   - Effective scraping and processing of legal data from multiple court websites.
   - **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) technology for extracting text from PDFs and other formats.

### 4. **User-Centric Interface**
   - **User-friendly dashboard** displaying case distributions, fraud patterns, and other insights.
   - **Compensation analysis** based on historical data to predict possible compensation amounts.
   - **Data visualization tools**, including fraud network graphs and named entity recognition (NER) for enhanced analysis.

### 5. **Actionable Insights and Reporting**
   - AI-powered predictions and identification of fraudulent activity.
   - **Automated reports** summarizing detected fraud trends and patterns.
   - Future enhancements include multi-language OCR support and improved graph-based insights.
